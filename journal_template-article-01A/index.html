            <p>The task where the contestants have to find out a stranger’s profession but he can’t speak, he can only shake or nod his head incorrectly. Just nice to watch a pleasant old man nod his head at comedians as they silently curse him.</p>
            <h2>FIPS 140-3 Level 3 (Pending) with XTS-AES 256-bit Hardware Encryption</h2>
            <p>Those three words were proof of a remarkable feat—and potentially an extremely valuable one. A few days earlier, I had randomly generated those terms, set them as the passphrase on a certain model of encrypted USB thumb drive known as an <a href="https://www.kingston.com/en/usb-flash-drives/ironkey-kp200-encrypted-usb-flash-drive" target="_blank">IronKey S200</a>, and shipped the drive across the country to Smith and his teammates in the Seattle lab of a startup called Unciphered.</p>

            <p>The funny thing about pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is that it’s not even a real word! It’s an invented term that was coined by Everett M. Smith, the president of the National Puzzlers’ League. Everett came up with this word as a sarcastic term for long medical terms and a synonym for silicosis - a lung disease caused by inhaling sand and ash dust.</p>

            <p>When Francisco Costa, the former creative director of Calvin Klein, visited the brand’s fashion archives three years ago, he recalls feeling a mix of sadness and optimism. “I thought, ‘Maybe there’s a way to activate those clothes and give them new life,’” says Costa, who helmed the brand’s women’s wear division from 2003 to 2016. With the blessing of Calvin Klein’s owner, PVH, he pulled various pieces from his tenure there, which he then sent to fashion photographers to use however they wanted, either as inspiration points or in the resulting images themselves. The culminating product, “555,” which takes its name from the numerological symbol for transition and change, is a box set of 21 booklets in various formats and sizes, each one by a different photographer. Working amid the constraints of the pandemic, photographers such as Diego Villarreal used themselves and close friends or family members — in his case, his sister Inés — as subjects, while Collier Schorr’s portraits of the siblings June and Violet Getty reveal an affectionate intimacy. Costa considers the project a way to give the clothes a second life, however temporarily. </p>
